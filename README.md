# Keisha
## My Virtual Desktop Assistant with Python AI
1. Installing the needed libraries and modules like `datetime` or `wikipedia`
   * `Pyttsx3` is a Python library that converts text to speech
   * `Speech_recognition` is a Python library that recognizes parts of our speech to create a model
2. Setting up my assistant and it's voice
   * In the **test.py** file, you heard the voice and the voice ID to choose your preference
4. Creating a `speak()` function, so Keisha says the string passed to it
5. Making sure Keisha can take commands from the microphone
   * This includes opening browser tabs to *Wikipedia*, *Google* or even playing music
